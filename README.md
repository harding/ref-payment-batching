# Payment batching reference materials

The following files were used to generate illustrations and data for a
[BitcoinTechTalk](https://bitcointechtalk.com/) article about payment
batching.

To use the python code, you need a Bitcoin Core node (0.15.0 tested) and
should run the following commands:

```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

To use the `*.plot` file, you will need to install gnuplot (version 4
tested).
